# SonnetGenerator
A sonnet generator, created as extra credit for my American Poetry class at UW.
It's a small program, done in HTML on Adobe Dreamweaver.

Credit to Amaranth Borsuk, my prof, for inspiring me to do this and the data poetry work of Nick Montfort and 
Lillian Yvonne-Bertram for being actual inspirations for combining my English majoring with coding skills.
