# Sonnet Generator
A sonnet generator, created as extra credit for my creative writing class.
It's a small program, done in HTML on Adobe Dreamweaver.

Credit to the work of Nick Montfort, Amaranth Borsuk, and Lillian-Yvonne-Bertram 
for being actual inspirations for combining my English majoring with coding skills.

Will be reading *Exploratory Programming for the Arts and Humanities* by Montfort
soon to use these skills in more depth.
