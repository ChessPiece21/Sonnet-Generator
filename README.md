# SonnetGenerator
A sonnet generator, created as extra credit for my American Poetry class at UW.
It's a small program, done in HTML on Adobe Dreamweaver. These sonnets are in
monometer because monometer is the best form.

Credit to the data poetry work of Nick Montfort and Lillian Yvonne-Bertram for being 
actual inspirations for combining my English majoring with coding skills.
