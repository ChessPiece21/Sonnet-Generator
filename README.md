# SonnetGenerator
A sonnet generator, created as extra credit for my American Poetry class at UW.
It's a small program, done in HTML on Adobe Dreamweaver.

Credit to the data poetry work of Nick Montfort and Lillian Yvonne-Bertram for being 
actual inspirations for combining my English majoring with coding skills.
