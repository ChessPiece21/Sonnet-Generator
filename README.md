# Sonnet Generator
A sonnet generator, created as extra credit for my American Poetry class at UW.
It's a small program, done in HTML on Adobe Dreamweaver. These sonnets are in
monometer because monometer is the best form.

Credit to the work of Nick Montfort, Amaranth Borsuk, and Lillian-Yvonne-Bertram 
for being actual inspirations for combining my English majoring with coding skills.

Will be reading ''Exploratory Programming for the Arts and Humanities'' soon to 
use this in more depth.
